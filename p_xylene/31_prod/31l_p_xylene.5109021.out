  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,
  proportional to (LJsigma/rcoulomb)^6. This could have a minor effect on
  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
  sigma value of 0.34 nm the fraction of the particle-particle potential at
  the cut-off at lambda=0.5 is around 7.3e-05, while ewald-rtol is 1.0e-05.

  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,

  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
